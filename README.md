# 🎭 Story-In-Frames

Turning static panels into moving stories — a fusion of code, creativity, and comics. 🎬✨  

## 📖 About the Project
**Story-in-Frames** is a short comic video that captures everyday humor through expressive characters, witty dialogues, and simple storytelling.  
Built using Python and animation tools, each frame comes alive as a seamless narrative — blending art, timing, and tech.

🪄 *Think of it as if your favorite comic strip learned how to move.*
