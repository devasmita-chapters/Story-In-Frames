# 🎭 Story-In-Frames

Turning static panels into moving stories — a fusion of code, creativity, and comics. 🎬✨  

## 📖 About the Project
**Story-in-Frames** A Python-coded comic strip video — created as a birthday surprise.

This project started as a fun experiment to turn a simple birthday wish into something creative — a comic-style video story built entirely with Python.

The comic follows a light-hearted, humorous narrative — a character reflecting on life, craving a beach escape, getting lost in food thoughts… and finally discovering a surprise birthday gift! 🎁

Using Pillow, NumPy, and MoviePy, each scene was transformed into animated comic panels with dialogue bubbles, smooth fade transitions, and background music.

💡 A mix of storytelling, code, and humor — proving Python can do a lot more than just data crunching.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
